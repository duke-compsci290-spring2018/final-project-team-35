    Recently, we’ve seen many future Duke students touring around the campus and thought that it seemed a bit monotonous. 
        <br>
        <br>

    We believe that Duke has a lot more to offer to visitors other than them to move around in huge groups without any freedom.	
        <br>
        <br>

    Most of duke’s tour program is systemized and a bit dull for students and don’t make Duke as attractive as it actually is. 
        <br>
        <br>

    Our purpose of this application is to offer famous and hidden attractions at Duke and automatically plan out possible visiting schedules based on preference of individuals. For example, if one likes what kind of campus life they can expect, the application will set-up a tour that includes the real campus life such as the Cameron Stadium or Pitchforks.
        <br>
        <br>

    What makes this app so special is that visitors can now plan tours based on their preferences rather than a wholistic tour of the school, which would be almost the same for every other schools. This app will provide a unique experience to visitors and really ignite prospective students’ interests to Duke. 
        <br>
        <br>

    We will use data from TripAdvisor for famous attractions at Duke and inputs from users and Duke students for hidden attractions such as the puppy center, greenhouse garden, and others. Our app will implement google map api to offer users the shortest route to look around the campus with the chosen attractions based on their preferences.
