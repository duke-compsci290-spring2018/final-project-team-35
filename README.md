- What makes your application useful: <br>
    This web is aimed to help people who are interested in looking around the Duke Campus, but don't know what Duke has to offer. This web page offers users to efficiently browse through things to do at Duke using category filters. Also, it will generate a map based on the selections you made and plot it on the google map to see where these places are located to plan a distance-efficient trip. Lastly, it also offers a forum where users could post reviews of the places they visited and comment if they wanted to.
- Special instructions needed to set up, run, access, or use your application (like user passwords you have set up, command line utilities, or external programs that need to be run): <br>
    To create a new account, user can simply enter his/her email on the login page and it will automatically direct to a sign-up menu. After signing up with our website, user can login and use most of the functions of our website. The administrator account is set to ID: admin@gmail.com and password: hello123. Guest could browse through the web page as well, but only signed in users will be able to save generated trips and use all functions of the forum. Administrators have full access to the website, including authority to delete unappropriate posts of any users in the forum. <br> To use the map generator, user simply has to pick the places they want to visit and add it to his/her cart. Afterwards, clicking the buttong "Generate Map" will create a map with markers on where each places are located it at. All generated trips are saved in the users account, so user can access his/her past trip at any time. <br> After visiting each places, users can leave reviews on the forum and read other's reviews. The posts are filtered in four different ways: Time, Likes, Comments, and Views. Each filters will display the most relevant post on the top based on the filter user chose.

- Discuss both the pros and the cons of different framework possibilities you considered and why you made the decision you did (including choosing not to use any framework): <br>
    We used vue and node.js because we decided to use components to create our web page. We also used vue router because we didn't want our page to reload every single time when user wanted to move to a different tab. It makes the user experience faster and more intuitive when using our website. We also liked the multiple tags vue had like v-if and v-for which was crucial in developing our website. We did look into other frameworks like angular and react, but vue was much lighter and easier to implement since we had a lot of experience with it throughout the entire semester. We implemented google maps api to display the places in an interactive map.
